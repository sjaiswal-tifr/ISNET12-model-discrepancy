# Discrepancy models for relativistic heavy-ion collisions

In this section we summarize result for a real-world example. 
The figures are from two papers, which apply discrepancy models based on 
Gaussian processes to data from relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments. 
The prior discrepancy functions take the same form as for the ball-drop example. 
The goal is to extract meaningful distributions for the specific bulk and 
shear viscosities ("specific" in this context means normalized by the entropy 
density) and other experimental observables.

## Bayesian model-data comparison incorporating theoretical uncertainties

In the following examples, simulate collisions of Au on Au nuclei at 
$\sqrt{s_\textrm{NN}} =200\,$GeV at $20-30\%$ collision centrality are 
simulated using the `iEBE-MUSIC` simulation framework. 
These simulations are considered to represent the "truth" (i.e., the true results). 
We use them to generate synthetic experimental data with noise. 
The theoretical model to be compared with these synthetic data is the same 
`iEBE-MUSIC` model but with a different ansatz for the momentum distribution 
at particlization (assuming local thermal equilibrium $f_{\text{eq}}$ instead 
of the Grad 14-moment momentum distributions for the particlized hadrons).

Using only the $E(dN_{\text{ch}}/d^3p)$ measurements (top left in 
{numref}`fig-Sunil_1_discrepancy_models_fig3`), all three cases (i)-(iii) 
yield posteriors that are statistically consistent with the truth. However, 
once the flow observables $v_2\{2\}_{\rm ch}$ and $v_3\{2\}_{\rm ch}$ are 
included (top middle), in the no model discrepancy (no-MD) case (red) the 
Bayesian fit clearly struggles to find optimal values for the parameters, 
producing significantly shifted posteriors that hit the edge of the prior 
range ("very wrong") while exhibiting exceedingly small uncertainties ("very confident"). 
Including MD using Kernel I (blue), the posteriors are once again statistically 
consistent with the truth, albeit with increased uncertainty ("much less confidence") 
for $\eta/s$. With Kernel II (green) the MD term captures the model imperfections 
for $v_2$ and $v_3$ much better, yielding posteriors similar to those obtained by 
ignoring the charged hadron anisotropic flow data. Once all available observables 
are included (top right), the inferred values for both model parameters agree with 
their true values, within significantly reduced uncertainties, as long as MD is 
accounted for (blue and green); without MD $\eta/s$ is very confidently inferred 
to be about $40\%$ larger than its true value.

The bottom panel of {numref}`fig-Sunil_1_discrepancy_models_fig3` compares the 
synthetic experimental data with their predictions from the calibrated model. 
Black boxes denote the median and $95\%$ credible intervals (CI) of the experimental 
data, while open gray boxes show predictions from the model using the true parameter 
values, the difference highlighting the effects of model imperfections. The 
colored (red, blue, green) points and vertical bars show the median and $95\%$ CI 
of the model predictions obtained from the inferred posteriors in the top right panel. 
Overall, predictions with MD (blue and green) are closer to the model predictions 
with the true parameters while those without MD (red) align more closely with the 
data. This demonstrates that the MD framework prioritizes obtaining correct parameter 
estimates over merely fitting the observables.

**Top row:** Plots display the $\eta/s$ posterior (median and $\pm 95\%$ CI) as a 
function of temperature, with the posterior for $\epsilon_{\rm sw}$ (median $\pm 68\%$ CI) 
shown in the inset, as additional observables are sequentially incorporated into 
the Bayesian inference (from left to right). **Bottom rows:** Model predictions 
based on inference using all observables.
:::

When only the momentum distribution $E(dN_{\text{ch}}/d^3p)$ is considered (top left), 
all three cases yield posteriors that are statistically compatible with the truth. 
However, for $\eta/s$ the posteriors accounting for MD (blue and green) overlap 
significantly better with the true values than those without MD (red). Once 
$v_2\{2\}_{\rm ch}$ and $v_3\{2\}_{\rm ch}$ are added to the calibration data (top middle), 
none of the posteriors uniformly covers the truth any more. When not accounting for MD (red), 
the posterior credible intervals for $\eta/s$ are very narrow (suggesting high confidence) 
but are completely inconsistent with the truth. Including MD helps a little but 
still infers $95\%$ credible intervals that do not cover the true value of $\eta/s$ 
over most of the temperature range. Apparently, the inference algorithm tries to 
compensate for the model's tendency to over-predict $v_2$ and $v_3$ by increasing $\eta/s$.
When all observables (including the spectra and elliptic flows of identified 
pions and protons) are added to the calibration data (top right), all posteriors 
become narrower (i.e., more constrained). The overlap of the posteriors accounting 
for MD improves, whereas the posteriors that do not account for MD degrade further.

Corner plot of all model parameters (with median $\pm 68\%$ CI displayed on the 
diagonals) for the five-parameter model with parametrized $\eta/s$, using synthetic 
data generated with fixed $\eta/s=0.1$ and $\epsilon_{\rm sw}=0.2\,$GeV/fm$^3$, 
corresponding to the results shown in {numref}`fig-Sunil_1_discrepancy_models_fig4`
:::

The model predictions in the bottom row of {numref}`fig-Sunil_1_discrepancy_models_fig5` 
(obtained from the inferred posteriors in the top right panel) reinforce our 
observations made in the two-parameter case: Predictions that include MD do not 
attempt to overfit the data (black) but remain closer to the model predictions 
using the true parameter values (open gray). In contrast, the predictions without 
MD overfit the data, resulting in the incorrect inference for $\eta/s$ observed 
in the top right panel.

Overall, the posteriors agree better with the true values (indicated by dashed 
gray vertical lines) when the model discrepancy (MD) term is included (for both 
Kernel I and Kernel II) compared to the no-MD case (red). Note that, since the 
generated synthetic experimental data do not depend on the parameter $T_{\rm kink}$, 
its posterior should ideally mirror the prior (shaded purple region). However, 
we observe that the posterior for $T_{\rm kink}$ peaks around a certain value e
ven in the MD inference, although its width is significantly larger than in the 
no-MD case. This may be an artifact of the overly flexible model, where the MD 
cases struggle to disentangle the effects of the model parameter from the GP 
hyperparameters. Nonetheless, the resulting $\eta/s$ posterior shown in 
{numref}`fig-Sunil_1_discrepancy_models_fig4` does not appear to depend crucially 
on this parameter.

Results for the five-parameter hydrodynamic simulation with parametrized $\eta/s$ 
using synthetic data generated using a parametrization of $\eta/s$ with 
$T_{\rm kink}{\,=\,}0.18\,{\rm GeV}$, $a_{\rm low}{\,=\,}{-}1\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, 
$a_{\rm high}{\,=\,}1\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, and $(\eta/s)_{\rm kink}{\,=\,}0.1$, 
along with $\epsilon_{\rm sw}{\,=\,}0.2\,$GeV/fm$^3$. The plot layouts and legends 
are identical to those in the previous figure. The corner plot for all five model 
parameters, when all available observables are included, is provided below.
:::

The results in {numref}`fig-Sunil_1_discrepancy_models_fig5` support the overall 
conclusions drawn from the preceding cases: inference including the MD term performs 
significantly better than inference without MD. Still, we observe that in this 
last example none of the cases (with or without accounting for MD) accurately 
captures the shape of $(\eta/s)(T)$. We suspect that the available data do not 
provide sufficient information to properly constrain it given the theoretical 
deficiencies (i.e. the neglect of viscous corrections in the particlization routine) 
of the model. Even with MD, simply knowing that the model is more reliable at 
small $p_T$ than at large $p_T$ is not enough to resolve the shape of $(\eta/s)(T)$. 
Nonetheless, the improvement over conventional Bayesian fits remains substantial.

Corner plot of all model parameters (with median $\pm 68\%$ CI displayed on the 
diagonals) for the five-parameter model with parametrized $\eta/s$, using synthetic 
data generated via the parametrization with $T_{\rm kink}=0.18\,{\rm GeV}$, 
$a_{\rm low}=-1$, $a_{\rm high}=1$, and $(\eta/s)_{\rm kink}=0.1$, along with 
$\epsilon_{\rm sw}=0.2\,$GeV/fm$^3$. This plot corresponds to the results shown 
in {numref}`fig-Sunil_1_discrepancy_models_fig5`.
:::

Overall better agreement with the true values is observed when the model discrepancy (MD) 
term is included (blue, green) compared to the no-MD case (red). The inability of 
the posteriors to accurately capture the slopes $a_{\rm low}$ and $a_{\rm high}$ 
is reflected in the nearly flat shape of $\eta/s$ as a function of temperature in 
{numref}`fig-Sunil_1_discrepancy_models_fig5` for the MD cases. We observe that 
the absence of increasing specific viscosity on either side of $T_{\rm kink}$, as 
seen in the truth, is compensated by an overestimated posterior for $(\eta/s)_{\rm kink}$ 
(for blue, green). We attribute the framework's inability to accurately capture 
the posteriors for these parameters to a combination of limitations in the theoretical model, 
insufficient information in data to constrain the slopes, and weak prior information 
regarding the model's domain used in the kernel modeling.



## Phenomenological constraints on QCD transport with quantified theory uncertainties

Reference: S. Jaiswal, "[Phenomenological constraints on QCD transport with quantified theory uncertainties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19759)", Phys.Lett.B 874 (2026) 140243.

In this work, a dramatic example of the value of informed Bayesian model discrepancies. 
The outcome is data-driven, state-of-the-art constraints on the temperature-dependent 
specific shear and bulk viscosities of the quark–gluon plasma from Pb–Pb collisions 
at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV. The approach is to perform global Bayesian 
calibration using the JETSCAPE multistage framework with two particlization ansatze, 
Grad 14-moment and first-order Chapman–Enskog, and quantify theoretical uncertainties 
via a centrality-dependent model discrepancy term. When theoretical uncertainties 
are neglected, the specific bulk viscosity and some model parameters inferred using 
the two ans¨atze exhibit clear tension. **Once theoretical uncertainties are quantified, 
the Grad and Chapman-Enskog posteriors for all model parameters become almost 
statistically indistinguishable and yield reliable, uncertainty-aware constraints.** 
Furthermore, the learned discrepancy identifies where each model falls short for 
specific observables and centrality classes, providing insight into model limitations.

In brief summary of Fig. {numref}`fig-Sunil_2_discrepancy_models_figs1_and_2`, the plots on the left in red and blue show parameters inferred from two different models (shrinkage from the gray priors show significant Bayesian updating), without discrepancy terms included: there is significant tension between extracted parameters that are physical quantities. On the right, after model discrepancy is included for both models, there is almost miraculous agreement in the predictions.

**Summary:**
Model–to-data comparison requires careful quantification of both experimental and theoretical
uncertainties. Theoretical models have inherent limitations, and using them beyond their 
domains of validity without accounting for theory error can bias parameter estimates, 
reducing model parameters to mere fitting variables. In the work shown here, a Bayesian 
framework that quantifies theoretical uncertainties was used to constrain the 
temperature-dependent shear and bulk viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma from 
Pb–Pb collision data at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV. It was shown that, 
without accounting for theory errors, the multistage JETSCAPE framework with Grad and 
Chapman–Enskog particlization leads to tensions in the inferred transport coefficients 
and model parameters. Once the theoretical uncertainties are quantified, these tensions 
disappear and the Grad and CE posteriors become statistically indistinguishable across 
all shared parameters. This collapse of the model dependence yields reliable constraints 
on QGP viscosities in the temperature range $T \sim$ 150-350 MeV, where first-principles 
calculations remain limited. The learned discrepancy further provides insight into 
the limitations of the theoretical models.
